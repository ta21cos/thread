# App Icons

This directory should contain the application icons in different formats:

- `icon.icns` - macOS icon file
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file  
- `icon.png` - Linux/general PNG icon (512x512 recommended)

You can generate these icons from a high-resolution PNG file using tools like:
- [electron-icon-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-icon-builder)
- [icon-gen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/icon-gen)
- Online converters

For now, the app will use the default Electron icon until proper icons are provided.
