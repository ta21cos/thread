# Thread - Product Context

## Purpose and Vision
Thread is designed to be a streamlined, user-friendly memo application that enables quick and efficient communication within teams or for personal use. It combines the simplicity of note-taking with the structured conversation flow of messaging platforms like Slack.

## Problems Solved
- **Information Overload**: By organizing discussions in threads, users can focus on specific topics without being overwhelmed by unrelated messages.
- **Context Switching**: Threaded discussions maintain context, reducing the cognitive load of switching between different conversation topics.
- **Information Persistence**: Unlike ephemeral chat messages, memos are designed to be persistent and easily retrievable.
- **Collaboration Barriers**: Provides a simple platform for sharing thoughts and collaborating without complex setup or learning curves.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: The interface should be intuitive and require minimal training to use effectively.
- **Speed**: Creating and accessing memos should be fast and responsive.
- **Accessibility**: The application should be usable by people with various abilities and on different devices.
- **Engagement**: The design should encourage regular use and participation.

## Target Users
- **Teams**: Small to medium-sized teams looking for a simple communication tool.
- **Individuals**: Users seeking a personal memo system with threading capabilities.
